      <h2>Gary</h2>
      <p>
        Gary, the grandson of renowned Pokémon Researcher, Professor Oak, has
        had a life long rivaly with Ash Ketchum. Starting based on a fishing
        scuffle where they both claimed ownership of a Pokéball used for
        fishing, Gary has always had it in for Ash. Gary started off as an
        extremely arrogant kid who somehow managed to amass a group of
        Cheerleaders, cheering only for Gary. After he lost in the Pokémon
        League, Gary ditched the cheerleaders and after some soul searching,
        started to become less arrogant and more of a compotent Pokémon Trainer.
        Finally, after his defeat against Ash, Gary, with humility, mended the
        fences with Ash finally and decided to stop being a Pokémon Trainer and
        instead to follow in his grandfather's footsteps and become a Pokémon
        Researcher.
