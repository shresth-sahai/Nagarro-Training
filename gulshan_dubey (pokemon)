        Pokémon[a][1][2][3] (an abbreviation for Pocket Monsters[b] in Japan) is
        a Japanese media franchise managed by The Pokémon Company, a company
        founded by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. The franchise was
        created by Satoshi Tajiri in 1996,[4] and is centered on fictional
        creatures called "Pokémon". In Pokémon, humans, known as Pokémon
        Trainers, catch and train Pokémon to battle other Pokémon for sport. All
        media works within the franchise are set in the Pokémon universe. The
        English slogan for the franchise is "Gotta Catch 'em All!".[5][6] There
        are currently 913 Pokémon species.[7]

        There have been 23 animated theatrical Pokémon films (latest film to be
        released on December 25, 2020[45]), which have been directed by Kunihiko
        Yuyama and Tetsuo Yajima, and distributed in Japan by Toho since 1998.
        The pair of films, Pokémon the Movie: Black—Victini and Reshiram and
        White—Victini and Zekrom are considered together as one film.
        Collectibles, such as promotional trading cards, have been available
        with some of the films. Since the 20th film, the films have been set in
        an alternate continuity separate from the anime series.

        Gary Oak is Professor Oak's grandson and Ash Ketchum's rival in the
        first few seasons. His starter Pokémon was a Squirtle that later evolved
        into a Blastoise. The day Gary started out on his Pokémon journey, he
        came off as an arrogant and egotistical Trainer. His chosen starter
        Pokémon was Squirtle, which was actually the same Pokémon that Ash
        originally wanted to start with.
