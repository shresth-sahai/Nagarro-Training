    <h3>Pokemon</h3>
    <p1>The Pokémon anime, often referred to as just "the anime" by Pokémon fans, is a collective term referring to currently 1,203 main series episodes, 
        23 movies, and a number of side stories, all focusing on Pokémon. The great majority of these focus on Ash Ketchum, a Pokémon Trainer from Pallet Town, 
        and his journey toward his ultimate goal of being a Pokémon Master, 
        his many friends, and most especially his Pokémon, whom he considers his partners and friends.
        Though the anime is ultimately based upon the games and draws heavily from them, many concepts which are only touched on the games are spun in a unique way, and expanded on.
        As of the end of March 2020, the anime has aired in 176[1] different countries and regions in over 30 languages. 
        It is available on Netflix in 217 countries with different dubs and subtitles, and all countries except Japan and South Korea have at least English audio.
        [2] The Pokémon Company International usually refers to the anime as the "Pokémon animated series" or "Pokémon television series", 
        while some event Pokémon based on Pokémon from the anime have their location set as "the Pokémon cartoon" in the English version of the games. It is also referred to formally as Pokémon the Series

    <h3>Ash Ketchum</h3>
    <p1>Ash Ketchum is the main protagonist of Pokémon the Series. He is a 10-year-old Pokémon Trainer from Pallet Town in the Kanto region who has always dreamed of becoming the world's greatest Pokémon Master. 
        The first human character to be introduced in the series, he is the winner of the Orange League and Kanto Battle Frontier and also the Alola region's Pokémon Champion, 
        receiving the title after winning its first Pokémon League Conference. He is also one of the 8 best trainers in the Pokémon World after defeating Raihan and reached Master Class in the World Coronation Series.
        On his 10th birthday, he realized he overslept. Ash rushed to Professor Oak's Laboratory to get his first Pokémon. Originally wanting to choose Squirtle, Bulbasaur or Charmander, but he ended up receiving the Pokémon Pikachu instead, 
        as he arrived late (thus leaving him with no other Starters to choose from even though this was his birthday). At first, Pikachu did not obey Ash and kept running away, so Ash had to tie him up. After getting chased by a flock of Spearow later in the day thanks to Ash's recklessness,
         Ash attempted to save Pikachu from them. Seeing that Ash was so determined to help him, Pikachu protected Ash from the Spearow by electrocuting the entire flock (which was thanks to being struck by lightning at that exact moment and having his Electric-type move supercharged). 
         From then on, Pikachu and Ash became best friends. As an unskilled Trainer, Ash traveled with Misty and Brock throughout the Kanto region, capturing new Pokémon along the way.

    <h3>Galy</h3>
    <p1>Galy is one of this year’s most talked-about artists. A self-taught prodigy in the field of 3D art and animation, he has made a name for himself creating nostalgic digital sculptures with themes inspired by a money-obsessed society. 
        Curious about painting and drawing from a young age, Galy began experimenting with 3D design when he was just 12 years old. Using the Internet as a teacher during a time when influencer tutorials had not yet saturated YouTube,
        his fascination with the work of Walt Disney and modern animated classics like Toy Story, motivated him to explore the creative process of digital sculpting on his own.
        Much of Galy’s work is the amalgamation of early cartoon classics and Galy’s own storytelling. 
        They are created based on memories from the artist’s earliest fascinations. “I would build a fantasy world from toys and action figures. 
        I never liked minimalism, I liked big worlds filled with life and characters. My favorite movie was Toy Story, I would watch it every day. 
        You could say that I became a 3D artist because of Toy Story.”
