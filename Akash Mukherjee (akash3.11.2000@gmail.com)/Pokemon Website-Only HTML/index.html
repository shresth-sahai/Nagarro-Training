              Brock, known as Takeshi (タケシ) in Japan, is a fictional
              character in the Pokémon franchise owned by Nintendo. In the
              Pokémon video games, he is the Gym Leader of Pewter City and
              mainly uses Rock-type Pokémon. In the anime series, Ash comes
              across a man that is later revealed to be Brock's father. He
              explains that Brock wanted to become a Pokémon Master but due to
              his father leaving, Brock had to take care of his many, many
              siblings and could not leave. This is why he became a gym leader,
              to stay close to his family. His father comes back and states that
              he will take care of the family. Brock left his position as a Gym
              Leader to travel alongside Ash Ketchum and became a revered
              Pokémon breeder. He later cultivates his skill in medicine, and
              goes to Pewter City in order to train and become a Pokémon doctor.
              He has also appeared in several Pokémon manga series, including
              Pokémon Adventures and the Ash & Pikachu manga.
