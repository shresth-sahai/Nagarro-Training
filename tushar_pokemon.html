    <h1>POKEMON </h1>
    <p>Pokémon(an abbreviation for Pocket Monsters in Japan) is a Japanese media franchise managed by The Pokémon

        <strong><em>Ash Ketchum</em></strong> is the main protagonist of Pokémon the Series. He is a 10-year-old Pokémon
        Trainer from Pallet Town in the Kanto region who has always dreamed of becoming the world's greatest Pokémon
        Master. The first human character to be introduced in the series, he is the winner of the Orange League and
        Kanto Battle Frontier and also the Alola region's Pokémon Champion, receiving the title after winning its first
        Pokémon League Conference. He is also one of the 8 best trainers in the Pokémon World after defeating Raihan and
        reached Master Class in the World Coronation Series.On his 10th birthday, he realized he overslept. Ash rushed
        to Professor Oak's Laboratory to get his first Pokémon. Originally wanting to choose Squirtle, Bulbasaur or
        Charmander, but he ended up receiving the Pokémon Pikachu instead, as he arrived late (thus leaving him with no
        other Starters to choose from even though this was his birthday). At first, Pikachu did not obey Ash and kept
        running away, so Ash had to tie him up. After getting chased by a flock of Spearow later in the day thanks to
        Ash's recklessness, Ash attempted to save Pikachu from them. Seeing that Ash was so determined to help him,
        Pikachu protected Ash from the Spearow by electrocuting the entire flock (which was thanks to being struck by
        lightning at that exact moment and having his Electric-type move supercharged). From then on, Pikachu and Ash
        became best friends. As an unskilled Trainer, Ash traveled with Misty and Brock throughout the Kanto region,
        capturing new Pokémon along the way.</font>

        <strong><em>Garry's Raticate</em></strong> the original Pokemon Red/Blue, when you encounter your rival in
        Lavender Town he asks whether or not you know what it's like to have one of you Pokemon die. At this point in
        the game, he no longer has his Raticate that he used in previous battles. Your rival battle before this took
        place aboard the S.S. Anne. Your rival's Raticate sustained serious injuries from the battle... But, because of
        crowding and confusion on the luxury liner, he was unable to make it to a Pokemon center in time and the
        Raticate passed away.


        The real reason your rival is in Lavender Town to begin with is to lay his deceased friend to rest. Despite all
        of the, your rival never outwardly tells you that you're responsible for the death of his Pokemon
