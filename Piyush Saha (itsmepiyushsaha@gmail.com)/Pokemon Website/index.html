    <h2 class="center">Gary Oak</h2>
    <p>
        The day Gary started out on his Pokémon journey, he came off as an arrogant and egotistical Trainer. His chosen
        starter Pokémon was Squirtle, which was actually the same Pokémon that Ash originally wanted to start with, and
        he even had a group of cheerleaders who cheered him on in all of his battles, and they would go so far as crying
        whenever he lost.
