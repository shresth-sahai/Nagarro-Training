        Ash Ketchum is a character appearing in Pokémon Journeys: The Series,
        who is the protagonist of Pokémon the Series whose aim to to be a
        Pokémon Master. Ash wears a new outfit that slightly resembles his
        original outfit. He wears a blue vest with yellow outlines, while his
        undershirt resembles the sleeping clothes that he wore in Kalos. He
        remains with no gloves as he did in Alola. He wears indigo shorts with
        black outlines coming from each side of his shorts similar to his Ultra
        Guardian uniform and wears black sneakers with blue highlights and a
        white "X" on front respectively. His hat resembles the one he wore in
        Hoenn, and the Poké Ball design is in a black shape of the letter C.
        During his second visit to Galar, he wears a Dynamax Band on his right
        wrist which he obtains from Leon. Also, Ash sometimes returns to wearing
        his Z-Power Ring on his left wrist whenever he is battling in an
        important match, especially World Coordination Series battles. During a
        visit to Kalos, Ash received a Key Stone from Korrina, which is on one
        of the gloves that look similar to the ones he worn during his Unova and
        Kalos journey, so he can use Mega Evolution.

      <p>
        Gary, the grandson of renowned Pokémon Researcher, Professor Oak, has
        had a life long rivaly with Ash Ketchum. Starting based on a fishing
        scuffle where they both claimed ownership of a Pokéball used for
        fishing, Gary has always had it in for Ash. Gary started off as an
        extremely arrogant kid who somehow managed to amass a group of
        Cheerleaders, cheering only for Gary. After he lost in the Pokémon
        League, Gary ditched the cheerleaders and after some soul searching,
        started to become less arrogant and more of a compotent Pokémon Trainer.
        Finally, after his defeat against Ash, Gary, with humility, mended the
        fences with Ash finally and decided to stop being a Pokémon Trainer and
        instead to follow in his grandfather's footsteps and become a Pokémon
        Researcher.
