        Pokémon, electronic game series from Nintendo that debuted in Japan in
        February 1996 as Pokémon Green and Pokémon Red. The franchise later
        became wildly popular in the United States and around the world. The
        series, originally produced for the company’s Game Boy line of handheld
        consoles, was introduced in 1998 to the United States with two titles,
        known to fans as Red and Blue. In the games, players assume the role of
        Pokémon trainers, obtaining cartoon monsters and developing them to
        battle other Pokémon. Pokémon became one of the most successful video
        game franchises in the world, second only to Nintendo’s Super Mario
        Bros.
