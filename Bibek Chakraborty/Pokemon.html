      The anime franchise consists of seven sequential series in Japan, each
      based on a main installment of the Pok√©mon video game series. In the
      international broadcasts, these series are split across 24 television
      seasons, with the 24th season, Master Journeys, streaming on Netflix in
      the United States (with additional episodes to be released quarterly).
      Each of the series follows Ash Ketchum, a young trainer of fictional
      creatures called Pok√©mon. Joined by his partner Pok√©mon Pikachu and a
      rotating cast of human characters, currently Goh, Ash goes on a journey to
      become a "Pok√©mon Master", travelling through the various regions of the
      Pok√©mon world and competing in various Pok√©mon-battling tournaments known
      as the Pok√©mon League. <br />
      The Pok√©mon anime series was largely credited for allowing anime to become
      more popular and familiar around the world, especially in the United
      States, where the two highest-grossing anime films are both Pok√©mon films.
      It is also considered to be one of the first anime series on television to
      reach this level of mainstream success with Western audiences, as well as
      being credited with allowing the game series to reach such a degree of
      popularity and vice versa. Pok√©mon is regarded as the most successful
      video game adaptation of all time,[4] with over 1000 episodes broadcast
      and adapted for international television markets, concurrently airing in
      192 countries worldwide and one of the most widely watched shows on
      Netflix, as of 2016.

    <p>
      Ash Ketchum is 10 years old and ready to start his journey in the world of
      Pok√©mon and dreams of becoming a Pok√©mon master, but on the day he is to
      receive his first Pok√©mon, Ash oversleeps and wakes up in a panic, running
      into Gary Oak, who becomes Ash's rival. Professor Oak, the local Pok√©mon
      researcher, has already given away the three Pok√©mon (Bulbasaur,
      Charmander, and Squirtle) he entrusts to new Pok√©mon Trainers when Ash
      finally reaches Oak's Lab. The only Pok√©mon that he has left is a Pikachu,
      which he gives to Ash. Determined to make it on his journey, Ash does his
      best to befriend Pikachu, but it refuses to trust him and chooses to stay
      out of the Pok√© Ball, even attacking Ash with its electric powers. It is
      only after Ash protects Pikachu from an angry group of Spearows that
      Pikachu realizes how much Ash cares. Ash Ketchum has the Thunder Stone,
      and he wants Pikachu to evolve into Raichu, but Pikachu refuses to evolve.
      <br />
      Along the way, Ash makes many human and Pok√©mon friends as he works his
      way through the ranks of the world's many Pok√©mon Leagues. Through the
      Kanto Region, Ash befriends Water Pok√©mon trainer and former Cerulean City
      Gym Leader Misty, and Pok√©mon Breeder and Pewter City Gym Leader Brock.
      Together, the three trainers thwart the plans of Jessie, James, and
      Meowth, low-ranking members of the criminal organization Team Rocket who
      want to steal Ash's Pikachu and any other rare Pok√©mon they come across.
      Giovanni, Team Rocket's Boss introduced three new high-ranking members of
      Team Rocket; Cassidy, Butch, and Raticate, who want to kidnap Pok√©mon so
      they can use their moves. Ash wins eight badges from Gym Leaders in the
      Kanto region to compete in the Indigo Conference League.

    <p>
      Gary Oak (Japanese: „Ç™„Éº„Ç≠„Éâ„Éª„Ç∑„Ç≤„É´ Shigeru Okido) is a recurring
      character who appeared in the Pok√©mon anime. He is a Pok√©mon Researcher
      from Pallet Town and grandson of Professor Oak. He is a childhood friend
      of Ash Ketchum and his main rival in the original series. In Pok√©mon
      Journeys: The Series, he serves as Goh's rival in Project Mew. His
      Japanese name is derived from Shigeru Miyamoto.Gary has been a neighbor of
      Ash Ketchum since they were both young. At one time, they seemed to be
      friends and went to see movies together, as seen in Lights, Camerupt,
      Action!. Shortly before beginning their journeys, Gary and Ash found an
      old Pok√© Ball while fishing. The two boys began fighting over who would
      get to keep the Pok√© Ball but ended up breaking it in half. Since then,
      they decided to keep the two separate pieces for themselves. It was
      revealed in The Ties That Bind that they still carried the pieces with
      them. <br />
      Gary made a brief appearance in Here Comes the Squirtle Squad, where he
      exited a town store, accidentally knocking Ash out in the process. In
      Mystery at the Lighthouse, Professor Oak revealed to Ash that Gary had
      already caught 45 Pok√©mon, compared to Ash's team of seven. Professor Oak
      also revealed that Gary's Pok√©mon included a much larger Krabby than the
      Krabby that Ash caught that episode. In Dig Those Diglett!, Gary was one
      of the Trainers who decided to help out the foreman in getting rid of the
      Diglett affecting construction at Gaiva Dam. Gary attempted to send out a
      Pok√©mon to battle the Diglett, but it did not exit the Pok√© Ball, and a
      Diglett returned it to him. He tried to send out his other Pok√©mon, though
      they also did not leave their Pok√© Balls and were returned to him by the
      Diglett. Realizing that his Pok√©mon did not want to battle the Diglett, he
      deemed it pointless to stay and left with his cheerleaders in their
      convertible.
