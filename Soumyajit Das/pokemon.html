      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <p>
        Pokémon (an abbreviation for Pocket Monsters in Japan) is a Japanese
        media franchise managed by The Pokémon Company, a company founded by
        Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. The franchise was created by
        Satoshi Tajiri in 1996, and is centered on fictional creatures called
        "Pokémon". In Pokémon, humans, known as Pokémon Trainers, catch and
        train Pokémon to battle other Pokémon for sport. All media works within
        the franchise are set in the Pokémon universe. The English slogan for
        the franchise is "Gotta Catch "Em All!". There are currently 913 Pokémon
        species.

        The franchise began as Pocket Monsters: Red and Green (later released
        outside of Japan as Pokémon Red and Blue), a pair of video games for the
        original Game Boy handheld system that were developed by Game Freak and
        published by Nintendo in February 1996. It soon became a media mix
        franchise adapted into various different media. Pokémon is estimated to
        be the highest-grossing media franchise of all time. The Pokémon video
        game series is the fourth best-selling video game franchise of all time
        with more than 440 million copies sold and one billion mobile downloads.
        The Pokémon video game series spawned an anime television series that
        has become the most successful video game adaptation of all time with
        over 20 seasons and 1,000 episodes in 192 countries. The Pokémon Trading
        Card Game is the highest-selling trading card game of all time with over
        43.2 billion cards sold. In addition, the Pokémon franchise includes the
        world's top-selling toy brand, an anime film series, a live-action film
        (Detective Pikachu), books, manga comics, music, merchandise, and a
        temporary theme park. The franchise is also represented in other
        Nintendo media, such as the Super Smash Bros. series, where various
        Pokémon characters are playable.

      <h2>Concept</h2>

      <p>
        Pokémon executive director Satoshi Tajiri first thought of Pokémon,
        albeit with a different concept and name, around 1989, when the Game Boy
        was released. The concept of the Pokémon universe, in both the video
        games and the general fictional world of Pokémon, stems from the hobby
        of insect collecting, a popular pastime which Tajiri enjoyed as a child.
        Players are designated as Pokémon Trainers and have three general goals:
        to complete the regional Pokédex by collecting all of the available
        Pokémon species found in the fictional region where a game takes place,
        to complete the national Pokédex by transferring Pokémon from other
        regions, and to train a team of powerful Pokémon from those they have
        caught to compete against teams owned by other Trainers so they may
        eventually win the Pokémon League and become the regional Champion.
        These themes of collecting, training, and battling are present in almost
        every version of the Pokémon franchise, including the video games, the
        anime and manga series, and the Pokémon Trading Card Game (TCG).
      </p>

      <p>
        In most incarnations of the Pokémon universe, a Trainer who encounters a
        wild Pokémon has the ability to capture that Pokémon by throwing a
        specially designed, mass-producible spherical tool called a Poké Ball at
        it. If the Pokémon is unable to escape the confines of the Poké Ball, it
        is considered to be under the ownership of that Trainer. Afterwards, it
        will obey whatever commands it receives from its new Trainer, unless the
        Trainer demonstrates such a lack of experience that the Pokémon would
        rather act on its own accord. Trainers can send out any of their Pokémon
        to wage non-lethal battles against other Pokémon; if the opposing
        Pokémon is wild, the Trainer can capture that Pokémon with a Poké Ball,
        increasing their collection of creatures. In Pokémon Go, and in Pokémon:
        Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!, wild Pokémon encountered by
        players can be caught in Poké Balls, but generally cannot be battled.
        <img

        />
        Pokémon already owned by other Trainers cannot be captured, except under
        special circumstances in certain side games. If a Pokémon fully defeats
        an opponent in battle so that the opponent is knocked out ("faints"),
        the winning Pokémon gains experience points and may level up. Beginning
        with Pokémon X and Y, experience points are also gained from catching
        Pokémon in Poké Balls. When leveling up, the Pokémon's battling aptitude
        statistics ("stats", such as "Attack" and "Speed") increase. At certain
        levels, the Pokémon may also learn new moves, which are techniques used
        in battle. In addition, many species of Pokémon can undergo a form of
        metamorphosis and transform into a similar but stronger species of
        Pokémon, a process called evolution; this process occurs spontaneously
        under differing circumstances, and is itself a central theme of the
        series. Some species of Pokémon may undergo a maximum of two
        evolutionary transformations, while others may undergo only one, and
        others may not evolve at all. For example, the Pokémon Pichu may evolve
        into Pikachu, which in turn may evolve into Raichu, following which no
        further evolutions may occur. Pokémon X and Y introduced the concept of
        "Mega Evolution," by which certain fully evolved Pokémon may temporarily
        undergo an additional evolution into a stronger form for the purpose of
        battling; this evolution is considered a special case, and unlike other
        evolutionary stages, is reversible.

        In the main series, each game's single-player mode requires the Trainer
        to raise a team of Pokémon to defeat many non-player character (NPC)
        Trainers and their Pokémon. Each game lays out a somewhat linear path
        through a specific region of the Pokémon world for the Trainer to
        journey through, completing events and battling opponents along the way
        (including foiling the plans of an evil team of Pokémon Trainers who
        <img
          src="./pokemon-universe.jpg"
          alt="image"
          width="512px"
          style="float: right; margin: 16px"
        />
        serve as antagonists to the player). Excluding Pokémon Sun and Moon and
        Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon, the games feature eight powerful
        Trainers, referred to as Gym Leaders, that the Trainer must defeat in
        order to progress. As a reward, the Trainer receives a Gym Badge, and
        once all eight badges are collected, the Trainer is eligible to
        challenge the region's Pokémon League, where four talented trainers
        (referred to collectively as the "Elite Four") challenge the Trainer to
        four Pokémon battles in succession. If the trainer can overcome this
        gauntlet, they must challenge the Regional Champion, the master Trainer
        who had previously defeated the Elite Four. Any Trainer who wins this
        last battle becomes the new champion.

      <h2>Pokémon Universe</h2>

      <p>
        Pokémon is set in the fictional Pokémon universe. There are numerous
        regions that have appeared in the various media of the Pokémon
        franchise. There are 8 main series regions set in the main series games:
        Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, Sinnoh/Hisui, Unova, Kalos, Alola, and Galar. Each
        of the eight generations of the main series releases focuses on a new
        region. Every region consists of several cities and towns that the
        player must explore in order to overcome many waiting challenges, such
        as Gyms, Contests and villainous teams. At different locations within
        each region, the player can find different types of Pokémon, as well as
        helpful items and characters. Different regions are not accessible from
        one another at all within a single game, only with the exception of
        Kanto and Johto being linked together in Pokémon Gold, Silver, Crystal,
        HeartGold and SoulSilver versions. There are also regions set in spinoff
        games and two islands in the Pokémon anime (Orange Islands and Decolore
        Islands), all still set within the same fictional universe.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each main series region in the Pokémon universe is based on a real world
        location. The first 4 introduced regions (Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, and
        Sinnoh/Hisui) are based on parts of Japan, with later regions being
        based on parts of the United States (New York City is Unova and Hawaii
        is Alola), France (Kalos), the United Kingdom (Galar), and Spain and
        Portugal (generation 9 region).
