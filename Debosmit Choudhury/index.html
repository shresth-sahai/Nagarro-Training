          Pokémon(an abbreviation for Pocket Monsters in Japan) is a Japanese
          media franchise managed by The Pokémon Company, a company founded by
          Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. The franchise was created by
          Satoshi Tajiri in 1996,and is centered on fictional creatures called
          "Pokémon". In Pokémon, humans, known as Pokémon Trainers, catch and
          train Pokémon to battle other Pokémon for sport. All media works
          within the franchise are set in the Pokémon universe. The English
          slogan for the franchise is "Gotta Catch ‘Em All!". There are
          currently 913 Pokémon species.<br /><br />
          The original Pokémon is a role-playing game based around building a
          small team of monsters to battle other monsters in a quest to become
          the best. Pokémon are divided into types, such as water and fire, each
          with different strengths. Battles between them can be likened to the
          simple hand game rock-paper-scissors. For example, to gain an
          advantage over a Pokémon that cannot beat an opponent’s Charizard
          character because of a weakness to fire, a player might substitute a
          water-based Pokémon. With experience, Pokémon grow stronger, gaining
          new abilities. By defeating Gym Leaders and obtaining Gym Badges,
          trainers garner acclaim.

          Pikachu, a yellow mouselike creature, is the undisputed face of
          Pokémon and helped the series become a worldwide phenomenon. Pokémon
          inspired a cartoon series, movies, books, a toy line, sequels,
          spin-offs, a clothing line, and a popular trading-card game. In spite
          of a friendly interface and little violence, Pokémon has not been
          without controversy, however. In 1999 the parents of two nine-year-old
          boys sued Nintendo, stating that the Pokémon card game had caused the
          children to develop gambling problems and likening the trading-card
          craze to an illegal lottery. Religious groups that discount the theory
          of evolution also targeted Pokémon, for showing Pokémon evolving into
          new creatures.
