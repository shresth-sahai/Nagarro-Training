          Pokémon (an abbreviation for Pocket Monsters in Japan) is a Japanese
          media franchise managed by The Pokémon Company, a company founded by
          Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. The franchise was created by
          Satoshi Tajiri in 1996,[4] and is centered on fictional creatures
          called "Pokémon". In Pokémon, humans, known as Pokémon Trainers, catch
          and train Pokémon to battle other Pokémon for sport

          Ash Ketchum, known as Satoshi (サトシ) in Japan, is a fictional
          character in the Pokémon franchise owned by Nintendo. He is the
          protagonist of the Pokémon anime and certain manga series as well as
          on various merchandise related to the franchise. Ash Ketchum was first
          mentioned in a video game at the dialogue of Pokémon Play It!, and his
          first appearance in a game was in Pokémon Puzzle League. Satoshi
          Tajiri, the creator of Pokémon, with whom Ash shares his Japanese
          name, has stated that Ash represents the 'human aspect' of the series,
          and that Ash reflects what he himself was like as a kid.[3]
