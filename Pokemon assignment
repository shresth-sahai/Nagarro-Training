    <h3><u>Gary Oak</u></h3>
    <p>
        Gary Oak is Ash's first rival. He is based on the character Blue from the Pokémon video game series. Like his counterpart Blue
        , Gary hails from Pallet Town and is the grandson of renowned Pokémon researcher Professor Oak. Like Ash, Gary collects 
        Gym badges and competes in Pokémon League tournaments in Kanto and Johto. At first, Gary is arrogant, always 
        traveling with cheerleaders who called out his name and constantly teases Ash's group whenever they meet.
         After losing to a more powerful opponent in the Indigo League, Gary dispenses with the cheerleaders and then
          becomes more open-minded. At the end of season 2 (Orange Islands), Ash and Gary have their first Pokémon battle in
           which Gary's Eevee beats Ash's Pikachu. When the battle is over, Gary starts on a new journey to Johto and this 
           subsequently influences Ash to follow him there. After losing to Ash in the Johto League, Gary decides to pursue a 
           career in Pokémon research, impeding his rivalry with Ash. Until his loss to Ash, Gary had always thought of Ash as a 
           poor trainer but he eventually comes to accept him as his equal. After Ash defeats the Battle Frontier and comes back to 
           Pallet Town, Gary and Ash have a battle between Gary's Sinnoh Pokémon, Electivire, and Ash's Pikachu. Electivire easily 
           beats Pikachu, which inspires Ash to travel to Sinnoh. While in Sinnoh, Gary becomes a Pokémon researcher working with 
           Professor Rowan. By this time, Ash and Gary have become more of friends than rivals and they even team up to protect 
           Pokémon from Pokémon Hunter J. After working together to protect a group of Shieldon from Pokémon Hunter J, they both 
           agree to remain "friends until the end." Gary appears in seasons 1-5 (where it was only revealed that he started off with 
           a Squirtle in season 5, while battling with a Blastoise)[20] and 9-12, as well as in a fantasy in the last Black and 
           White episode, "The Dream Continues!". He returns in Journeys as he was taking part in Project Mew missions, while 
           travelling across the world to conduct his research. He reunites with Ash, meets Goh and battles Moltres alongside 
           the duo. It is also revealed he frequently visits his grandfather and Ash's Pokémon reserves. Gary also persuaded Goh to 
           take part in the Project Mew missions by acting like what he was during his rivalry with Ash. It is also revealed that 
           he watched Ash's battle against Paul in the Sinnoh League. Gary's Japanese name, Shigeru Okido is a reference to 
           Shigeru Miyamoto, the mentor of Pokémon creator Satoshi Tajiri.
