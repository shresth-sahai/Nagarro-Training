            <article>
                Chloe Cerise is a character appearing in the Pokémon Journeys: The Series. She is the daughter of Professor Cerise and Talia Cerise, and Parker Cerise's older sister. She normally attends school in Vermilion City.

                Although Chloe is 10 years old, she stayed in school, instead of traveling on a Pokémon journey. This was until she grew closer with the family pet Yamper when he protected her from a Gengar, followed by her finding an Eevee and deciding to capture her, making her become her partner. Thus, she decided to travel with her childhood friend Goh and Ash Ketchum to help with her father's research occasionally.
