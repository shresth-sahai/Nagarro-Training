    Have you ever wondered which Pokémon are the most powerful? Maybe, which ones specifically would dominate the rest? Well, we compiled a list of the 20 most powerful Pokémon & we think you might be surprised by a couple that made the list.
    
  </p>

  <center><h2>1.Mewtwo</h2></center>
  <img class="abc" src="https://publish.one37pm.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/screen-shot-2020-12-23-at-11-54-06-am.png?fit=1210%2C1250" alt="">
  <p class="main-text">If one thing is certain, Mewtwo is the champion of Powerful Pokémon. Standing six-foot, seven inches, and 269 pounds, the scientific creation Mewtwo, is the spawn of a pregnant Mew that had its DNA altered. Capable of controlling the mind of its enemies & teleportation, Mewtwo is undaunted. In the recent Detective Pikachu film, Mewtwo’s abilities are on full display, personifying how devastatingly powerful this Pokémon is. There is no real match for Mewtwo.</p>
  <center><h2>2. Mew</h2></center>
  <img class="abc" src="https://publish.one37pm.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mew-journeys.png?fit=1360%2C765" alt="">
  <p class="main-text">Although Mew is the last Pokémon in the 1st Generation, it has the DNA of every original Pokémon. Standing at 1’04” in height and under 9 pounds, you wouldn’t expect this adorable Pokémon to be capable of using any attack. Mew can also become invisible at will and is only able to be seen through a microscope. In Mewtwo Strikes Back, Mew battles Mewtwo to save humanity, with Ash Ketchum and Pikachu's help. Mew alone can’t beat the top Pokémon on this list.</p>
  <center><h2>3. Arceus</h2></center>
  <img class="abc" src="https://publish.one37pm.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/screen-shot-2020-12-23-at-11-58-43-am.png?fit=1360%2C1213" alt="">
  <p class="main-text">This is where things get hairy. Dubbed The Original One, Arceus is the most mythical of any Pokémon. Creating multiple regions (Ransei & Sinnoh) and maybe even the Pokémon Universe, Arceus is one of the oldest Pokémon even though he isn’t from the first or second generation. At 10” and over 700 Pounds, Arceus is imposing in character and ability. Capable of disappearing or stopping time, Arceus is arguably the most powerful Pokémon. It would be epic to see Arceus battle the remaining two on this list.</p>
  <center><h2>4. Rayquaza</h2></center>
  <img class="abc" src="https://publish.one37pm.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/screen-shot-2020-12-23-at-12-03-49-pm.png?fit=1360%2C1111" alt="">
  <p class="main-text">The massive Rayquaza is one of the oldest Pokémon, with estimations around multiple hundreds of years in age. At 23” and 455 pounds, this dragon Pokémon has the ability to fly and can unleash one of the strongest attacks of any Pokémon. Rayquaza is also the leader of the Legendary Birds of the Hoenn Region (Groudon & Kyogre) and even has the ability to calm its counterparts. Raquaza is the only Pokémon capable of learning Dragon Ascent, which inflicts damage and decreases the opponents’ defense and special defense abilities.</p>
  <center><h2>5. Lugia</h2></center>
  <img class="abc" src="https://publish.one37pm.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/screen-shot-2020-12-23-at-12-07-23-pm.png?fit=1360%2C1068" alt="">
  <p class="main-text">One of the most recognizable Generation 2 Pokémon, Lugia certainly has the power to back it up. Known as the “Guardian of the Seas,” Lugia has the ability to cause the seas to get rough or calm. When it comes to how powerful Lugia is, the estimation is that just flapping its wings can cause massive storms. Due to this, Lugia prefers to live deep in the ocean to avoid causing damage. Lugia is a Flying and Psychic Pokémon that doesn’t evolve and is the legendary birds' leader.</p>
