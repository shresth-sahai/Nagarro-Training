        <h1 style="text-align: center"> Gary </h1>

        <p>
            Gary, the grandson of renowned Pokémon Researcher, Professor Oak, has had a life long rivaly with Ash Ketchum. Starting
            based on a fishing scuffle where they both claimed ownership of a Pokéball used for fishing, Gary has always had it in
            for Ash. Gary started off as an extremely arrogant kid who somehow managed to amass a group of Cheerleaders, cheering
            only for Gary. After he lost in the Pokémon League, Gary ditched the cheerleaders and after some soul searching, started
            to become less arrogant and more of a compotent Pokémon Trainer. Finally, after his defeat against Ash, Gary, with
            humility, mended the fences with Ash finally and decided to stop being a Pokémon Trainer and instead to follow in his
            grandfather's footsteps and become a Pokémon Researcher.
