    <h1>POKEMON</h1>
    <p>Pokémon[a][1][2][3] (an abbreviation for Pocket Monsters[b] in Japan) is a Japanese media franchise managed by
        The
        Pokémon Company, a company founded by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. The franchise was created by Satoshi
        Tajiri in 1996,[4] and is centered on fictional creatures called "Pokémon". In Pokémon, humans, known as Pokémon
        Trainers, catch and train Pokémon to battle other Pokémon for sport. All media works within the franchise are
        set in
        the Pokémon universe. The English slogan for the franchise is "Gotta Catch ‘Em All!".[5][6] There are currently
        913
        Pokémon species.</p>

    <p>When it comes to Pokémon, you are either completely aware of it and have been following the games, the anime, the
        movies, the trading cards and everything else, or are completely bewildered by the Pokémon mania that’s gripping
        the Internet right now. Regardless of which camp you are in, sit back, grab your beverage of choice and relax—we
        are going to take a trip back in time to the very beginning of Pokémon.

        Pokémon is short for “Pocket Monsters", the original Japanese name. The franchise has its roots in a gaming
        magazine in the early 1980s in Japan—Game Freak, started by Satoshi Tajiri and Ken Sugimori. Tajiri was the
        writer, while Sugimori was the illustrator.</p>
