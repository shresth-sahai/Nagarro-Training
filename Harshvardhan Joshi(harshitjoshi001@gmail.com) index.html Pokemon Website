    <h1>Kakuna</h1>
 
    <p>
        Kakuna is an insect-like Pokémon with an appearance similar to that of a yellow chrysalis. As a chrysalis, the interior of Kakuna's very hard shell is unseen, with no limbs or other features being shown. Only Kakuna's eyes, jet black in color, are visible on the shell, which are somewhat large in proportion to its body. In Pokémon Red and Blue Versions, Kakuna had arm-like limbs, which were never seen afterwards.

    <p>Nidoking attacks his foes by sweeping his large and bulky tail, his horn also contains venom.In Nidoran families, Nidoking assume the roles of protectors and hunters, patrolling in search of food to bring back to their burrows for their mates and offspring.An enraged Nidoking is particularly dangerous, as it will go on a rampage that can only be stopped either by defeating the Pokémon—a difficult task that only a few Pokémon can accomplish—or by being calmed down by its partner Nidoqueen.Threatening their families is one of the most common triggers for such attacks. Luckily, their rarity in the wild in combination with their tendency to stay away from human settlements makes berserk Nidoking a very rare, albeit still very dangerous, problem in most metropolitan areas</p>
