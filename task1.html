            <strong><em>Ash Ketchum</em></strong> is the main protagonist of Pokémon the Series. He is a 10-year-old Pokémon Trainer from Pallet Town in the Kanto region who has always dreamed of becoming the world's greatest Pokémon Master. The first human character to be introduced in the series, he is the winner of the Orange League and Kanto Battle Frontier and also the Alola region's Pokémon Champion, receiving the title after winning its first Pokémon League Conference. He is also one of the 8 best trainers in the Pokémon World after defeating Raihan and reached Master Class in the World Coronation Series.On his 10th birthday, he realized he overslept. Ash rushed to Professor Oak's Laboratory to get his first Pokémon. Originally wanting to choose Squirtle, Bulbasaur or Charmander, but he ended up receiving the Pokémon Pikachu instead, as he arrived late (thus leaving him with no other Starters to choose from even though this was his birthday). At first, Pikachu did not obey Ash and kept running away, so Ash had to tie him up. After getting chased by a flock of Spearow later in the day thanks to Ash's recklessness, Ash attempted to save Pikachu from them. Seeing that Ash was so determined to help him, Pikachu protected Ash from the Spearow by electrocuting the entire flock (which was thanks to being struck by lightning at that exact moment and having his Electric-type move supercharged). From then on, Pikachu and Ash became best friends. As an unskilled Trainer, Ash traveled with Misty and Brock throughout the Kanto region, capturing new Pokémon along the way.</font>
