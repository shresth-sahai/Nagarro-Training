    <h2>Gary Oak</h2>
    <p>Gary Oak is Professor Oak's grandson and Ash Ketchum's rival in the first few seasons. The day Gary started out
        on his Pokémon journey, he came off as an arrogant and egotistical Trainer. His chosen starter Pokémon was
        Squirtle, which was actually the same Pokémon that Ash originally wanted to start with, and he even had a group
        of cheerleaders who cheered him on in all of his battles, . His style of training at that point was to capture
        many Pokémon and to use the strongest, as a stark contrast to Ash, who was more focused on developing a bond
        with his Pokémon. during the Johto saga, Gary seemed to have become the complete opposite of who he was. He
        became much more polite and respectful to others, including Ash.

        However, he still considered Ash his rival and would continue to do so until after their better at the Silver
        Conference.

        Gary used his Blastoise against Ash's Charizard in a hope to win by type matchups, but was defeated by Ash's
        Charizard. After this he decided that he wanted to become a Pokémon researcher, like his grandfather.

        Gary became an even better person during the Hoenn and Sinnoh travels because he gives Ash great advice, and
        helps him out when he needs his help. Sometimes Gary still teases Ash, but to a lesser extent.
