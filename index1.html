            <p> 
               The day Gary started out on his Pokémon journey, he came off as an arrogant and egotistical Trainer. His chosen starter Pokémon was Squirtle, which was actually the same Pokémon that Ash originally wanted to start with, and he even had a group of cheerleaders who cheered him on in all of his battles, and they would go so far as crying whenever he lost. He didn't walk on his journeys like most Trainers did; instead he had his own sporty red convertible with a chauffeur. Gary loved when he got a chance to make fun of Ash by bragging about how far behind Ash was compared to him. He also gave Ash the pet-name of "Ashy-boy" (Japanese: "Satoshi-kun"), which occasionally seems to annoy him. His style of training at that point was to capture many Pokémon and to use the strongest, as a stark contrast to Ash, who was more focused on developing a bond with his Pokémon.
