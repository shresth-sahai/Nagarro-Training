<p style="font-size: 20px";>Pokémon[a][1][2][3] (an abbreviation for Pocket Monsters[b] in Japan) is a Japanese media franchise managed by The Pokémon Company, 
    a company founded by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. The franchise was created by Satoshi Tajiri in 1996,[4] and is centered 
    on fictional creatures called "Pokémon". In Pokémon, humans, known as Pokémon Trainers, catch and train Pokémon to battle other
     Pokémon for sport. All media works within the franchise are set in the Pokémon universe. The English slogan for the franchise is
      "Gotta Catch ‘Em All!".[5][6] There are currently 913 Pokémon species.[7]

    In 1998, Nintendo spent $25 million promoting Pokémon in the United States in partnership with Hasbro, KFC, and others.[14]
     Nintendo initially feared that Pokémon was too Japanese for Western tastes but Alfred Kahn, then CEO of 4Kids Entertainment
      convinced the company otherwise.[15] The one who spotted Pokemon's potential in the United States was Kahn's colleague Thomas
       Kenney.[16]

In November 2005, 4Kids Entertainment, which had managed the non-game related licensing of Pokémon, announced that it had agreed
not to renew the Pokémon representation agreement. The Pokémon Company International oversees all Pokémon licensing outside Asia.[17]
 In 2006, the franchise celebrated its tenth anniversary.[18] In 2016, the Pokémon Company celebrated Pokémon's 20th anniversary by
  airing an ad during Super Bowl 50 in January and re-releasing the first Pokémon video games 1996 Game Boy games Pokémon Red, Green 
  (only in Japan), and Blue, and the 1998 Game Boy Color game Pokémon Yellow for the Nintendo 3DS on February 26, 2016.[19][20] 
  The mobile augmented reality game Pokémon Go was released in July 2016.[21] The first live-action film in the franchise, Pokémon 
  Detective Pikachu, based on the 2018 Nintendo 3DS spin-off game Detective Pikachu, was released in 2019.[22] The eighth generation
   of core series games began with Pokémon Sword and Shield, released worldwide on the Nintendo Switch on November 15, 2019.
